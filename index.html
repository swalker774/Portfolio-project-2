<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I am a current software eengineering student at Thinkful. I live in Lnasing, Michigan</p>
  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I Graduated from Michigan State University with a bachelor's degree in Psychology. Currently I work with children with autism implementing a teaching style known as Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA). I have been doing this sort of work for nearly two and a half years, and I was previously enrolled in graduate school hoping to continue learning about ABA. As time went on, it became clear to me that this kind of work was not what I was meant to do. I came across a couple ads for coding bootcamps and developed an intrest in coding. After some research I decided to pursue becoming a software developer and I'm very excited about the opportunity to learn this skill. Outside of web development I am interested in sports, movies, and spending time with frineds and family. I'm a big Detroit sports fan, and I love the Spartans! I also love to golf in the summertime and snowboarding in the winter.</p>
