<p>I am a current software eengineering student at Thinkful. I live in Lnasing, Michigan. Outside of web development my interests include:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Sports</li>
            <li>Movies</li>
            <li>Time with friends and family</li>
        </ol>
   
    <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I Graduated from Michigan State University with a bachelor's degree in Psychology. Currently I work with children with autism implementing a teaching style known as Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA). I have been doing this sort of work for nearly two and a half years, and I was previously enrolled in graduate school hoping to continue learning about ABA. As time went on, it became clear to me that this kind of work was not what I was meant to do. I came across a couple ads for coding bootcamps and developed an interest in coding. After some research I decided to pursue becoming a software developer and I'm very excited about the opportunity to learn this skill.</p>
